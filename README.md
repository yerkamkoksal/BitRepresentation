# BitRepresentation Project

## Overview
The `BitRepresentation` project is a C++ template class implementation for representing and manipulating bit-level data. It is designed to work with different data types and offers various functionalities to interact with binary and hexadecimal representations of data.

## Key Features
- Templated class `BitRepresentation` that can work with different data types (e.g., int, short).
- Functions to convert data into binary and hexadecimal string representations.
- Methods to set and unset specific bits in the data.
- Functionality to check if a specific bit is set.
- Ability to retrieve the numeric value of the data.

## Structure
The project is divided into two main files:
1. `BitRepresentation.h`: The header file contains the template class declaration along with its member functions and private data member.
2. `main.cpp`: The implementation file where the `BitRepresentation` class methods are defined and a demonstration of the class functionalities is provided in the `main` function.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Basic knowledge of terminal or command prompt usage


## Usage

After running the executable, the program demonstrates the functionalities of the BitRepresentation class, such as setting bits, converting to binary and hexadecimal formats, and retrieving the numerical value.
